# 📊 Ecommerce Sales Dashboard in Excel

This project showcases a **professional and interactive Ecommerce Sales Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel**.  
It is part of my learning journey toward **Data Analytics / MIS / Business Intelligence roles**.

The dashboard provides clear insights into **sales performance, inventory status, and stock health** using real-world business logic.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The dashboard helps answer key business questions such as:
- What is the **total sales and inventory value**?
- Which products are **high, normal, or low in stock**?
- Which products are **top-selling**?
- How does **inventory value vary by product**?

All analysis is done using **Excel formulas, Pivot Tables, Power Query, and slicers**.
